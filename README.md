# toolbox

I've made this toolbox to accomplish several things. 

## 1. Convenience

Since we don't write essays in machine code, _everyone_ exploits an abstraction when using computers. An OS is the equivalent of a vastly complicated multitool, but sometimes the built-in stuff doesn't work for specific cases.

With the web, most hackers will get a specific app, use it, then promptly forget about it. Then, months or years later, they'll rediscover it while researching a solution, then promptly forget it.

This is to make a quick-reference, at least for myself, but hopefully for anyone else.

## 2. Awareness

I'm fairly certain many developers reinvent the wheel because they don't realize that someone already made that thing.

Naturally, there are limits to this. Refactoring is complicated.

But, on the whole, if I need something to stretch audio or batch compare files, I'd like to know it exists.

Plus, if you're _not_ the software developer type, there's a very high chance that a CLI-based software won't do it for you.

## 3. Future Convenience

There are lots of things here that I _might_ find useful someday.

So, this is a bit like a hoarder's barn, but collecting less dust and proportionally smaller.

## Rules

For brevity's sake, I'm mostly glossing over a few groups:
* The built-in tools. If I need them, they're there.
* Paid tools, at least when they make me pause to consider purchasing.

I've marked ☁ for web apps and ⬛ for portable apps, most of which are through [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/). I've marked ⬇️ if the program isn't portable or requires download. If it's a reference sheet, it's marked with *.

## Organization Convention (updated 2020-09-09)

Is it some type of direct communication tool?
* [Communicating.md](https://github.com/PhilosAccounting/toolbox/blob/master/Communicating.md)

Is it making something new?
* Managing
  * Is it dealing with hardware?
    * Mgmt.Hardware.md
