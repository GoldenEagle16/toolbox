A professional must be aware of three dimensions:
* Claims and validates niche expertise
* Aware of other affiliated experts that surpass them
* Capable of delegating work

Most respectable developers accomplish the first and naturally understand the second. However, many people reinvent the wheel because they want to do it "better".

While a fancier UI or more baked-in features would make the interfacing experience more seamless, a plebeian just needs to know if that tool exists and which one is good enough.

A computer, abstracted, is merely a device that gathers, stores, and outputs information. Professionals with computers deal with information that mostly isn't theirs.

I've marked ☁ for web apps and ⬛ for portable apps, most of which are through [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/). I've marked ⬇️ if the program isn't portable or requires download. If it's a reference sheet, it's marked with *.

Since I usually remember when I pay for things, for brevity's sake most of these things are free.
