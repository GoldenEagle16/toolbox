# toolbox

This is not an exhaustive list. I recommend one of the following for that:

- Websites that give gigantic piles of alternatives like [Slant](https://www.slant.co/) or [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/)
- One of the hundreds of AWESOME LISTS OF EVERYTHING EVER MADE TO DO A THING that jockey for a top 100 position on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)
- Piles of curated search content such as [Curlie](https://curlie.org/) run by many passionate people at once

This is my quick-reference, a type of link-based [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), and I've made it for several purposes.

## 1. Understanding

When we find familiarity in computers, we often forget it can do more than we expected.

Thankfully, plenty of innovative software developers build things that expand our horizons and break our expectations.

If we grasp what their software is doing, those extra information management tools create extra [understanding](https://gainedin.site/understanding) and [effectiveness](https://gainedin.site/results) with the world _beyond_ the computers themselves.

When I find those tools, I add them here.

## 2. Convenience

With the web, most people download something, use it, then promptly forget about it. Then, months or years later, they'll research a solution and rediscover it, then promptly forget it again.

On occasion, I find something that's so stunningly good that I don't trust my own memory to hold such a valuable treasure.

When I find those treasures, I add them here.

## 3. Awareness

Many people remake existing software because they don't realize someone already made it.

That's not _always_ true, of course:

- Refactoring is complicated, and it's often hard to find _precisely_ what you want.
- Some software developers want to test whether they're smart enough to reinvent the wheel and make it better.
- Sometimes it's very educational or downright _fun_ to reinvent the wheel.
- If someone has severe trust issues, they'll make an open-source or lobotomized version of that thing.

When an existing tool becomes obsolete, forced behind a paywall, merged into some other big software suite, is no longer supported, or [was closed-source the entire time and the creator became tyrannical](https://notageni.us/ip), [reverse-engineering is always a thing](https://trendless.tech/hacking).

However, the largest mental hurdle in the first place is knowing a tool even _exists_. The idea can live on if someone knows another human already did it, but we have a harder time accomplishing what we believe to be impossible.

When I find something I think people shouldn't forget, I add them here.

## 4. Future Convenience

I _might_ find lots of things useful here someday, but I couldn't tell you what I want to do in 4 years.

The only alternative to this pile of links is to store terabytes' worth of information in the off-chance that it could be useful someday.

If my hoarding tendencies flare up and I think something might be useful, I add it here.

## Rules

The definition of "tool" is hairy:

- Every tool revolves around [human purpose](https://gainedin.site/purpose/), which is a concept created as a [relative human value](https://gainedin.site/values/).
- The [cognitive bias](https://gainedin.site/bias) of Maslow's Hammer means we're stuck always interpreting a tool according to what we're presently working on.
- [Hacking](https://trendless.tech/hacking) can involve using _anything_ for a purpose it wasn't intended for.

So, for brevity's sake, I'm mostly glossing over a few groups:

- The built-in tools. If I need them, they're in the computer already, and I'll make a nod to them on [my tech essays](https://trendless.tech).
- Most [mega-corp](https://gainedin.site/groups-large) tools. They already pay for plenty of [advertising](https://notageni.us/marketing/) and are _literally_ the first thing that comes up when you type that need into a search engine.
- Paid tools when they cost enough that it makes me pause to consider [my budget](https://adequate.life/money-3/). I'm a big proponent of [free licenses](https://trendless.tech/floss/) whenever possible.
- Most courses and courseware, which describe how to manipulate a specific tool more than what that tool does.
- Anything [associated with a scandal](https://trendless.tech/faang), [highly politicized](https://gainedin.site/conservative-liberal), [debatably close to illegal](https://notageni.us/legally-safe), or [was hacked](https://trendless.tech/hacking). I've got enough drama in my life without looking for more.

If there are lots to choose from, I try to prioritize:

1. Free-as-in-freedom [FLOSS](https://trendless.tech/floss), if possible
2. Free-as-in-beer free, if possible
3. Affordably-priced, if possible
4. Whatever happens to work

Nothing I do here is exhaustively research, and it's all hand-curated, so it won't change that quickly if something new comes along. You can usually tell how exhaustive my efforts are by how much I've earmarked an individual tool.

I cannot attest to the validity of the software, so [caveat emptor](https://notageni.us/legal-doctrines). Sometimes things become bloatware or malware, and sometimes I simply trust the software developer wasn't lying. Trust no one, and validate the software for yourself.

## Groups

I've broken everything into malleable and somewhat arbitrary groupings, since there are _many_ things that someone could use a computer for, and people are constantly adding new things:

- Audio: to work with sound for some intended aesthetic
- Communicating: to communicate with other people, directly or indirectly
- Files/OS: to manage computer files or operating systems
- Games: to work and play with games
- Hardware: to make or manage physical things, which includes computer hardware
- Internet: a sub-division of computer networking that has its own subdomains
- Math: for calculation-specific needs
- Money: for lucre-specific needs
- Network: for computers across a network
- Text: to work with language for some intended aesthetic
- Visual: to visually design or adapt things which contain some intended aesthetic

Sometimes, it makes sense to clarify for context how something is used.

- _*_ if it's something to copy-paste or a reference sheet.
- ☁ for browser-based apps, ⇉ for a browser/software plugin or extension
- Desktop: ⊞ for Windows, ⌘ for Mac OS X, 🐧 for Linux and Friends.
- Mobile: 🤖 for Android, 🍎 for iOS.
- □ for non-UI CLI-based tools, often requires [programming experience](https://trendless.tech/prog-basics).
- ■ for standalone files or portable Windows apps (many through [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/)).
- 🔌 if it's an API or has API documentation
- ⦿ for a data-heavy tool that may interest devs
- 💾 if it's self-hostable
- 🐍 if it runs in Python
- 🕵️ if it helps with trust issues
- 🆓 if it's FLOSS
- $ if it does cost at least some money

Further, some patterns keep cropping up in each domain:

- Consuming: human consumption only, without modification to it
- Foraging: to acquire others' created works

Further further, there are other groups if it's too meta to fit into any one of the above categories:

- Dev: to broadly make or manage computer code, which may refer to front-end or back-end, be language-specific, and may simply be a more nuanced version of any of the above
- Internet: sorta networking, sorta Everything Else
- Productivity: to broadly streamline doing any of the above

These are volatile out-of-the-box OS estimations for several reasons:

- If the specs on a computer are high enough (and they often are if the software is >5 years old), you can make almost any software run on any popular OS. Quick-and-dirty still does the job, even if it's running on an MS-DOS emulator inside a Windows 98 VM on a ROM side-loaded on the SD card of a smartphone.
- Developers keep making new things for new technologies, so this is constantly becoming obsolete or adapting to new standards.
- In ten years a standard OS might have everything I've saved pre-installed on it, meaning this won't really matter.
