# toolbox

I've made this toolbox to accomplish several things.

## 1. Convenience

This is to make a quick-reference, at least for myself.

Since we don't write essays in machine code, _everyone_ exploits an abstraction when using computers. An OS is the equivalent of a vastly complicated multitool, but with modular pieces that can range from a rocket ship to a chainsaw.

With the web, most hackers will get a specific app, use it, then promptly forget about it. Then, months or years later, they'll rediscover it while researching a solution, then promptly forget it again.

## 2. Awareness

I'm fairly certain many developers reinvent the wheel because they don't realize that someone already made that thing.

Naturally, there are limits to this. Refactoring is complicated, and it's often hard to find *precisely* what you want.

But, on the whole, if I need something to stretch audio or batch compare files, knowing it exists is the largest mental hurdle.

Plus, if you're _not_ the software developer type, there's a very high chance that CLI-based software scares you. While a mouse and touchscreen is groovy, sometimes you want to do the same 20,000 computer tasks and typing "del _*.*_ sacares you.

## 3. Future Convenience

There are lots of things here that I _might_ find useful someday, but I don't feel like lugging around 4 terabytes of constantly updating programs just to know where they are.

So, this is a bit like a hoarder's barn, but collects less dust and proportionally smaller.

## Rules

For brevity's sake, I'm mostly glossing over a few groups:

* The built-in tools. If I need them, they're in the computer already.
* Paid tools, at least when they make me pause to consider purchasing.
* Courses and courseware (unless it helps you make them), since you only need to learn about "xyz" once.
