# toolbox

I've made this toolbox to accomplish several things.

## 1. Convenience

This is to make a quick-reference, at least for myself.

Since we don't write essays in machine code, _everyone_ exploits an abstraction when using computers. An OS is the equivalent of a vastly complicated multitool, but with modular pieces that can range from a rocket ship to a chainsaw.

With the web, most people will get a specific app, use it, then promptly forget about it. Then, months or years later, they'll rediscover it while researching a solution, then promptly forget it again.

## 2. Awareness

I'm fairly certain many developers reinvent the wheel because they don't realize that someone already made that thing.

Naturally, there are limits to this. Refactoring is complicated, and it's often hard to find *precisely* what you want.

But, on the whole, if I need something to stretch audio or batch-compare files, my largest mental hurdle is knowing something like it exists. I imagine this is a universal human thing beyond myself.

## 3. Future Convenience

I _might_ find lots of things here useful someday, but I don't feel like dragging around 4 terabytes of constantly updating programs just to know where they are.

So, this is a bit like a hoarder's barn, but collects less dust and is proportionally smaller.

## Rules

For brevity's sake, I'm mostly glossing over a few groups:

* The built-in tools. If I need them, they're in the computer already.
* Paid tools, at least when I have to pause to consider my budget.
* Most courses and courseware, since the means of accomplishing many things in a computer are *constantly* changing technology fashions.

I've broken everything into malleable groupings, since there are *many* things that someone could use a computer for, and people are constantly adding new things. These groupings have a philosophical basis in their designed *final* purpose:

* Consuming: to digest, ingest, percolate, understand, skim, learn, without any creative goals in mind
* Foraging: to acquire others' creative works
* Calculators: to create a simple, usually numerical solution
* Communicating: to communicate with other people, directly or indirectly
* Hardware: to make or manage physical things, which include computer information on the OS level
* Software: to broadly make or manage conceptual things
* Visual: to visually design or adapt things which contain some intended aesthetic
* Audio: to create or manipulate sound for some intended aesthetic
* Text: to create or manipulate language for some intended aesthetic
* Productivity: to broadly streamline doing any of the above

## What it needs, out-of-the-box

* _*_ if it's something to copy-paste or a reference sheet.
* ‚òÅ for browser-based apps, ‚áâ for a browser/software plugin or extension
* Desktop: ‚äû for Windows, ‚åò for Mac OS X, üêß for Linux and Friends.
* Mobile: ‚àè for Android, ‚àê for iOS.
* ‚ñ° for non-UI CLI-based tools.
* ‚ñ† for standalone files or portable Windows apps (many through [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/)).
