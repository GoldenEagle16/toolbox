# toolbox

This is not an exhaustive list. I recommend one of the following for that:

- Websites that give gigantic piles of alternatives like [Slant](https://www.slant.co/) or [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/)
- One of the hundreds of AWESOME LISTS OF EVERYTHING EVER MADE TO DO A THING that jockey for a top 100 position on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).
- Piles of curated search content such as [Curlie](https://curlie.org/), run by many passionate people at once.

This is my quick-reference knowledge base, a link-based [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), made for several purposes.

## 1. Understanding

The definition of "tool" is more complex than first impulses may dictate:

1. Every tool revolves around [human purpose](https://gainedin.site/purpose/), which is a concept created as a [relative human value](https://gainedin.site/values/) derived as the difference between [perceived reality](https://gainedin.site/reality/) and [what is imagined to be possible](https://gainedin.site/imagination/).
2. Our [cognitive bias](https://gainedin.site/bias), specifically "law of the instrument", means we're stuck always interpreting a tool according to what we're presently working on.
3. [Hacking](https://trendless.tech/hacking) can involve using _anything_ for a purpose it wasn't intended for.

When we're familiar with computers, we often forget it can do more than we expect.

Thankfully, clever software developers keep build things that expand our horizons and break our expectations.

Those extra [information management](https://notageni.us/information/) tools can create extra [understanding](https://gainedin.site/understanding/) and [effectiveness](https://gainedin.site/results/) with the world _beyond_ the computers themselves.

When I find useful tools, mostly computer-based, I add them here.

## 2. Convenience

The internet has created a strange trend:

1. Someone searches for something they need.
2. They download and use that tool.
3. They promptly forget about the tool.
4. Months or years later, they need to do that thing again.
5. Recurse to Step 1.

I often find neat things, but I don't trust my memory, so I add them here to avoid re-researching. **MOST OF THIS IS NOT TESTED. I AM NOT LIABLE IF YOU DOWNLOAD A VIRUS. DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE**

Since someone can use a computer for _many_ things, and people are constantly inventing new things, everything is broken into malleable and somewhat arbitrary groupings:

- Audio: to work with sound for some intended aesthetic
- Communicating: to communicate with other people, directly or indirectly
- Files/OS: to manage computer files or operating systems
- Hardware: to make or manage physical things, which typically includes computer hardware
- Internet: a sub-division of computer networking that has its own subdomains
- Math: for calculation-specific needs
- Money: for lucre-specific needs
- Network: for computers across a network
- Text: to work with language for some intended aesthetic
- Visual: to visually design or adapt things which contain some intended aesthetic

There are other "fallback" spork groups if it's too meta to fit into any one of the above categories:

- Business: to somehow conduct [business](https://notageni.us/business/) with others (e.g., [marketing](https://notageni.us/marketing/), [accounting](https://notageni.us/accounting/))
- Dev: to broadly make or manage computer code, which may refer to front-end or back-end, be language-specific, and may simply be a more nuanced version of any of the above
- Games: to create and play games
- Internet: sorta networking, sorta Everything Else
- Productivity: to broadly streamline doing any of the above

Further, some patterns keep cropping up in each domain:

- Consuming: human consumption only, without modification to it
- Foraging: to acquire others' created works

## 3. Awareness

Many people remake existing software because they don't realize someone already made it.

Of course, that's not _always_ true:

- It's often hard to find _precisely_ what you want, and refactoring can be complicated.
- Some software developers reinvent the wheel or [reverse-engineer something](https://trendless.tech/hacking), just for fun.
- Reinventing the wheel is very educational, even if its results aren't always useful.
- An existing tool might become obsolete, jammed behind a paywall, merged into some bloated software suite, or the software's owner [became tyrannical](https://gainedin.site/bad-systems/) over [their IP](https://notageni.us/ip).
- For any reason whatsoever, a developer may start distrusting software and will make a lobotomized or [open-source](https://trendless.tech/floss/) version of it.

However, the largest mental wall for most people is knowing a tool even _exists_. If someone knows another human already did it, we know it's possible. It's much harder accomplishing what everyone thinks is impossible.

For brevity's sake, I try to bias against a few groups:

- The built-in tools. If I need them, they're in the computer already, and if it's that important I'll reference them on [my tech essays](https://trendless.tech).
- Most [mega-corp](https://gainedin.site/groups-large) tools. They already pay for plenty of [advertising](https://notageni.us/marketing/) and are _literally_ the first thing on a search engine.
- Paid tools when they cost enough that it makes me pause to consider [my budget](https://adequate.life/money-3/). I'm a big proponent of [free licensing](https://trendless.tech/floss/) whenever possible, and I'm aware other people don't always have money to do things.
- Most courses and courseware, which describe how to manipulate a specific tool more than what that tool does.
- Anything [associated with a scandal](https://trendless.tech/faang), [highly politicized](https://gainedin.site/conservative-liberal), [debatably close to illegal](https://notageni.us/legally-safe), or [was hacked](https://trendless.tech/hacking). I've got enough drama in my life without looking for more.

## 4. Future Convenience

I _might_ find lots of things useful here someday, but I couldn't tell you what I want to do several years from now.

I have been a data hoarder in the past, and the only alternative is to store terabytes' worth of hypothetically useful software.

I don't know what I'll use, so I aim for things I anticipate will be around in 5-10 years, which omits many candidates:

1. If the site is interpreted as suspicious by government authorities (e.g., [for piracy](https://trendless.tech/torrent/)), it's not likely to stick around, though some future iteration of it will float out there somewhere.
2. When the tool is bleeding-edge technology (e.g., [AI](https://trendless.tech/ai/) right now), it'll likely get shoved behind a vastly overpriced paywall, with an open-source iteration of it floating out there somewhere.
3. Tech startups like to create "kitchen sink" tools that do many things, but within a few years it's almost certain that tool will be repurposed once they've found their market or were acquired by a [FAANG corporation](https://trendless.tech/faang/).
4. Quick-reference sheets are great, but they should _still_ be useful later on. Some [protocols](https://trendless.tech/protocols/) move around, others stay nearly the same.
5. Large-scale [enterprise-grade](https://trendless.tech/enterprise/) software must be maintained by [large-scale entities](https://gainedin.site/groups-large/), so its monolithic nature is mostly its undoing relative to an open-source implementation of the same solution.

If there are lots of tools to choose from, I try to prioritize:

1. Free-as-in-freedom [FLOSS](https://trendless.tech/floss), if possible
2. Free-as-in-beer free, if possible
3. Affordably-priced, if possible
4. Whatever happens to work

I also leave earmarks for reference.

    - ⦿ - data-intensive tool
    - 🐍 - runs in Python
- Its business model:  
    - 🆓 - [FLOSS](https://trendless.tech/floss/)
    - ⬆️ - freemium model
    - $ - requires paying at least some money
    - 🧛 - [FAANG](https://trendless.tech/faang) website (i.e., Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft)
- 💩 - it's a recursed pile of stuff, curated by someone else
- ~~strikethrough~~ for bad tools, with a clear explanation

These icons are volatile out-of-the-box guesstimates, for several reasons:

- If the specs on a computer are high enough (and they often are if the software is >5 years old), a multipurpose OS can run almost any software, even if it's an unlocked fridge running a sideloaded Linux on an SD card to run Windows 98 to run MS-DOS.
- Developers keep making new things for new technologies, so this is constantly becoming obsolete or adapting to new standards. From the time you read this, most of this toolbox is good for about 10 years.
- Addon features have a funny way of becoming built-in features as everyone uses it, and built-in features will often become lobotomized to make something more efficient or profitable. Nothing is permanent.

You can usually tell how much I use it by how much I've earmarked an individual tool.

## YMMV

I cannot attest to the validity of the software, so [caveat emptor](https://notageni.us/legal-doctrines). I trust the software developer wasn't lying. Trust no one, and validate the software for yourself.

I also can't attest to the _current_ validity or comparative quality of the software. This is hand-curated by me, so it won't quickly change if something new comes along.

And, further further, I am not legally responsible for anything that happens from any software, data, or misuse of that data or software. I'm literally volunteering my time to manually scrape things for free, so everyone is already getting the royalties of whatever you'd want to sue me over.

I also [make other useful things as well](https://stucky.tech/creations).
