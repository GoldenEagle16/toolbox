# toolbox

A professional must be aware of three dimensions:
* Claims and validates niche expertise
* Aware of other affiliated experts that surpass them
* Capable of delegating work

Most respectable developers accomplish the first and naturally understand the second. However, many people reinvent the wheel because they want to do it "better" or are unaware of what's already out there.

A computer is, by its nature, a multitool with built-in tools (aka "commands"). With only a little curiosity and experience, most people discover them immediately.

A computer has an extensible design _built_ for replacing parts. The meatspace analogue is a Swiss Army Knife where you can enlarge or remove the corkscrew, attach a chainsaw or secure a nuclear-powered rocket engine to it.

On an unfamiliar project, a plebeian/n00b just needs to know a tool exists. They don't care if the sub-sub-sub-niche industry has better options or if it's legacy software. Plus, my unofficial experience is that when people see deprecated software for a clear need, 3 devs create better versions (usually FOSS).

The worst pencil is better than the best memory, so I stick links to neat things here that I _might_ find useful someday. Like a hoarder's barn, but collecting less dust and proportionally smaller.

For brevity's sake, I'm mostly glossing over a few groups:
* The built-in tools. If I need them, they're there.
* Paid tools, at least when they make me pause to consider purchasing.

I've marked ☁ for web apps and ⬛ for portable apps, most of which are through [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/). I've marked ⬇️ if the program isn't portable or requires download. If it's a reference sheet, it's marked with *.
