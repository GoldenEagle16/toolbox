# toolbox

I've made this toolbox to accomplish several things.

## 1. Convenience

This is to make a quick-reference, at least for myself.

Since we don't write essays in machine code, _everyone_ exploits an abstraction when using computers. An OS is the equivalent of a vastly complicated multitool, but with modular pieces that can range from a rocket ship to a chainsaw.

With the web, most people will get a specific app, use it, then promptly forget about it. Then, months or years later, they'll rediscover it while researching a solution, then promptly forget it again.

## 2. Awareness

I'm fairly certain many developers reinvent the wheel because they don't realize that someone already made that thing.

Naturally, there are limits to this. Refactoring is complicated, and it's often hard to find *precisely* what you want. Plus, sometimes it's *fun* to reinvent the wheel.

But, on the whole, if I need something to stretch audio or batch-compare files, my largest mental hurdle is knowing something like it exists. Even if something gets replaced, put behind a paywall, merged into something else, or just plain forgotten, the free market of idea-based creation will prevail.

## 3. Future Convenience

I _might_ find lots of things here useful someday, but I don't feel like dragging around 4 terabytes of constantly updating programs just to know where they are.

So, this is a bit like a hoarder's barn, but collects less dust and is proportionally smaller.

## Rules

For brevity's sake, I'm mostly glossing over a few groups:

* The built-in tools. If I need them, they're in the computer already.
* Paid tools, at least when I have to pause to consider my budget.
* Most courses and courseware, since the means of accomplishing many things in a computer are *constantly* changing technology fashions.

I've broken everything into malleable groupings, since there are *many* things that someone could use a computer for, and people are constantly adding new things. These groupings have a philosophical basis in their designed *final* purpose:

* Consuming: to experience others' created works without any creative goals in mind
* Foraging: to acquire others' creative works
* Calculators: to create a simple, usually numerical solution
* Communicating: to communicate with other people, directly or indirectly
* Hardware: to make or manage physical things, which include computer information on the OS level
* Software: to broadly make or manage conceptual things
* Visual: to visually design or adapt things which contain some intended aesthetic
* Audio: to create or manipulate sound for some intended aesthetic
* Text: to create or manipulate language for some intended aesthetic
* Productivity: to broadly streamline doing any of the above

## What it needs

* _*_ if it's something to copy-paste or a reference sheet.
* ‚òÅ for browser-based apps, ‚áâ for a browser/software plugin or extension
* Desktop: ‚äû for Windows, ‚åò for Mac OS X, üêß for Linux and Friends.
* Mobile: ü§ñ for Android, üçé for iOS.
* ‚ñ° for non-UI CLI-based tools.
* ‚ñ† for standalone files or portable Windows apps (many through [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/)).
* üêç if it runs in Python

These are volatile out-of-the-box estimations for several reasons:

* If the specs are high enough (and they usually are), you can make any software run on any popular OS. Quick-and-dirty still does the job, even if it's running on an MS-DOS emulator inside a Windows XP VM.
* Developers keep making new things for new technologies, so in ten years everyone might have BlahBlahOS where everything runs on it and these won't matter.

## What I'm looking for

Please feel free to pull request if you have anything I've missed. Or, if tech's not your thing, contact me via "greg at stucky dot tech":

1. Things that are obsolete, along with a better replacement.
2. Additional clarification of relevant necessary platforms/languages the tool needs.
3. Any classes or sub-classes of tool I may have missed.

Also, right now I'm *really* looking for the following:

* Free or affordable access to technology standards (e.g., ISO 9000)
  
If you like what you see, feel free to fork, or visit [my website](https://stucky.tech) for other useful things.
